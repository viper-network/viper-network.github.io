# viper-network.github.io

Web application to browse the Steem blockchain with such swag much ease built using the [asteroidjs](https://github.com/asteroidjs/asteroidjs) (meteor on steroids) architectural framework which is subject to changes.

In a true open source "by the people, for the people" nature, we try to work closely with our community and invite everyone to have their say to provide a better overall experience, aiming to create an web environment and application that is fun and easy to use, while still having a lot of stuff to master. We're going towards a more professional environment and devlopment either in the domains of the open-source nature and primordial community building.

We try to maintain a standard of friendly behaviour in our community, so don't be afraid to speak up and have your say in building this application for us all!

## Feedback

We're currently looking for more "average" user's feedback mainly concerning colours, design etc.. it is our priority, performance along with security-related feedback are still welcome but no longer needed. Thanks for sharing the app and feedback to non IT oriented folks!
